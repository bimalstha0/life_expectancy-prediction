# Life Expectancy Prediction Notebook
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the prediction of life expectancy using various regression models. The goal is to explore and compare the performance of different regression algorithms on a dataset related to life expectancy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Life Expectancy Data(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who), which includes various features such as income composition of resources, education, BMI, HIV/AIDS, and more. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure compatibility with regression models.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
